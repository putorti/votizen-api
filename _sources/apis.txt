Basic Resources
===============
Our basic APIs allow access to single services or information about specific
resources.

Location Services
-----------------

:doc:`geocode`
    * input: a `CASS-certified postal address`_
    * output: longitude/latitude coordinates and estimated precision.
:doc:`district`
    * input: longitude/latitude coordinates, precision
    * output: electoral district IDs containing these 
      coordinates

Voter Data
----------
   
:doc:`voter_verifier`
    * input: Name, location, and date of birth
    * output: whether we were able to match the query to a voter roll record 
      and, if matched, the Votizen-assigned Voter ID (for use in other Voter 
      resources).
      
:doc:`voter_record`
    * input: Voter ID
    * output: party registration and voting history for the requested voter


Composite Resources
===================
Our composite resources chain together two or more of our 
:ref:`apis--basic-resources` in commonly-used combinations.  This is convenient, 
saves you requests, and prevents you from waiting for multiple round-trip 
requests so you get your answers faster.

:doc:`ballot` 
    :doc:`geocode` -> :doc:`district` -> collection of in-district races and respective candidates
